## Let's Get Caught Up

If you've been following along, you know that we've been diving into the world of music data analysis. In this post, we're going to take a closer look at the factors that contribute to the success of Billboard's top hits. We'll be using a dataset that includes various features of songs, such as tempo, key, and energy level, to see how they correlate with chart performance. We'll also explore the distribution of these features and how they vary across different genres. By the end of this post, you'll have a better understanding of what makes a song a hit and how you can explore these trends further.

In our previous blog post (check it out <a href="https://ericanti.github.io/my-blog/blog/api-usage/" target="_blank">here</a>), we discussed how to use API calls to get the acoustic features of Billboard Hot 100 hits from 1969 as well as 2019, we also briefly touched on some exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques. In this post, we'll dive deeper into EDA and how it can help us understand the data better.

## How Has Music Evolved Over Time?

Previously, we looked at how music has evolved over the years. We found that older songs tend to be happier with more male artists, while newer songs have a more diverse range of artists and are generally sadder. Let's take a closer look at the shift in genres over the years. We'll use a bar plot to visualize the distribution of genres in our dataset. This will help us understand how the popularity of different genres has changed over time.
