### Recap: Setting the Stage

In our <a href="https://ericanti.github.io/my-blog/blog/api-usage/" target="_blank">last post</a>, we covered how to fetch acoustic features of Billboard Hot 100 hits from both 1969 and 2019 using API calls. We also introduced some basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques. This time, we‚Äôre going deeper‚Äîlooking at how features like tempo, key, and energy relate to chart performance, and how these features differ across genres and decades.

### How Has Music Changed Over Time?

#### Key Takeaways

- Older hits (1969) tended to be happier and featured more male artists.
- Newer hits (2019) show greater artist diversity and lean sadder in mood.

Let‚Äôs visualize how genre popularity has shifted:

**What‚Äôs changed?**

**Observations:**
- In 2019, top-charting songs tend to be sadder, especially those with longer chart runs.
- In 1969, most hits were happier, but interestingly, the #1 songs were often sad.
- This pattern could suggest that emotional resonance, not just cheerfulness, drives a song‚Äôs staying power.

### Try It Yourself: Interactive Data App

We built a <a href="https://ericanti-post3-streamlit-main-bzlgmr.streamlit.app/" target="_blank">Streamlit app</a> to let you explore these trends hands-on.

#### Getting Started

When you open the app, you‚Äôll see a sidebar with filters:

- **Year Selector:** Focus on 1969, 2019, or both.
- **Genre Filter:** Zero in on specific genres.
- **Weeks on Chart:** Filter for songs with real staying power.

There‚Äôs also a handy ‚ÄúHow To Use‚Äù section in the sidebar for quick guidance.

### üìä Overview Tab

This tab gives you a high-level summary of your filtered dataset, helping you spot broad trends at a glance.

**What you‚Äôll see:**
- **Total Songs Analyzed:** Instantly see how many songs match your current filters. This helps you gauge the size of your data slice and ensures your analysis is focused.
- **Average Weeks on Chart:** Find out how long, on average, songs stay on the Billboard Hot 100. This can reveal how competitive the music landscape is in different years or genres.
- **Genre Proportions by Year:** Compare how popular genres have changed over time. For example:
  - Is pop dominating in recent years?
  - Did rock or jazz have a bigger share in the past?
  - Are there any emerging genres gaining traction?

*How to use it:*  
Adjust the filters to focus on specific years or genres and watch how the genre proportions shift. This is a great way to spot macro trends, such as the rise of hip-hop or the decline of classical hits on the charts.

### üéµ Custom Analysis Tab

This is your ‚Äúsandbox‚Äù for creative exploration.

**Get creative:**
- Pick any two features (e.g., ‚Äúpeak position‚Äù vs. ‚Äúweeks on chart‚Äù, ‚Äúbpm‚Äù vs. ‚Äúloudness‚Äù) to see how they relate.
- Color by mood, gender, or year to add another dimension to your analysis.
- Split by year for side-by-side comparisons.

*How to use it:*  
Ask your own questions, such as:
- Do happier songs tend to chart higher?
- Is there a relationship between tempo (bpm) and chart longevity?
- Are there gender or genre differences in how long songs stay on the charts?

**Tip:**  
Try combining filters and color options to uncover non-obvious patterns‚Äîlike whether sad songs in pop last longer than happy songs in rock, or if 2019‚Äôs hits are generally louder than those from 1969.
